# 19th May 2022 

## Things to bear in mind
Our main priority after this round of research will be Accessibility, here’s the timeline:
* w/c 16 May - internal accessibility review started (automated tests, etc)
* w/c 23 May - start addressing some of the issues raised
* w/c 3 June - stabilise final designs, including new Roadmap page (if we receive content in time) and fix as many issues as possible before external audit
* 14-15 June - external agency conducts accessibility audit, they will produce a report with more issues that automated testing can't pick up
* w/c 15 June- 1 July - fix any remaining issues raised by external agency and publish a draft Accessibility Statement
* w/c 6 July - re-submit the site for external accessibility audit and update the statement based on results
* 14 July - Beta assessment
